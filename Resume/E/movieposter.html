The movie is set in New York in a dystopian near future, 2 years into a presidential term of a semi-fascist leader, backed by a repressive government. Due to continuing terrorist attacks and immigrant crisis, as well as the growing wealth gap, the Western world is swept by a wave of polarized views: tolerant and liberal on one side, and discriminating and repressive on the other. In the States, New York is one of the most prominent centers of liberal thought provided with more freedom of speech.

An Upper East Side raised teenage girl finds herself alienated from her peers by caring deeply about the worsening situation and not relating to her friends’ materialistic approach – being raised away from the ghetto-like neighborhoods and discrimination, they remain indifferent to the political situation as long as their lifestyle needs are satisfied. She uses their trendy, street-style aesthetic to build a large following for her anti-government graffiti art, which she executes in secrecy at night under the pseudonym V, relating to one of her favorite movies, V for Vendetta.

The movie begins with a foreshadowing of a large protest in front of a Manhattan courtroom (possibly with voiceover of the protagonist), which then transitions back into the past of her, spray painting her art. As she is nearly finished, two policeman patrolling the neighborhood notice her and the chase begins. She manages to escape, and as she nervously walks home, she passes by government propaganda posters and a fallen, ghetto like neighborhood. Upon arriving home, she looks for her art on social media, to her content seeing that her newest piece, like many before, had already become very popular and received much positive feedback. In the background, a news anchor is presenting a story stating that a few members of Anonymous have been caught and arrested.

The next day at her private school, a day of her senior year of high school passes by, and in history class, she is learning about Nelson Mandela. During a break, she notices her classmates looking at her art on the internet. When a boy in her art class comments that her line is similar to the graffiti, she dismisses him. Back at home, she is skyping with her older sister, who is a doctor volunteering in a civil war zone in Kenya. The two have a very good relationship, and as the conversation progresses, it becomes evident that the older sister had served as a mediator in her conflicts with their parents before leaving. The main character misses her sister a lot and complains that the atmosphere at home has worsened since she had left.

While spray painting again at night, she is noticed by an impoverished man who recognizes her work and discovers her identity. She chooses not to run away, and the two begin to talk. Soon, he expresses his surprise over her identity and privileged background, openly becoming angry over her origins and neglecting her good intentions, stating that she does not have the right to address issues she has no idea about, and condemns her. When she walks away, she is strongly affected by his criticism and tries to make sense of the conversation.

As she arrives home, she finds her parents to still be up and overhears their conversation. Her father, an active member of the oppressed but still functioning democratic party, secretly helped provide political asylum to an ex-secret service agent, who leaked government files into the internet, providing proof for some of their discriminating actions. The mother was unaware of the situation up until she had heard rumors circulating amongst the high society earlier that day, and confronted her husband about it. She strongly opposed his actions and expressed concern over its possible consequences.

The conversation is broken off by a phone call, announcing that their older daughter is very sick with Malaria and might not make it. Over the course of the following days, the parents try to arrange for a transport back to the states and proper hospitalization, but due to the strict regulations imposed by the new government, despite their influential position they are unable to bring her home. The father tires to pull strings with his connections in Washington, and is summoned by his friend and the head of the democratic party – the father hoping that it is to announce that he had found a way. Upon arriving in his office, it turns out that the government is pressuring the party to force her father to step down and remove himself from the political scene, threatening to arrest him if he refuses to do so.

Getting back from school the following day, she finds her parents at home, contemplating in silence, and finds out about the situation and her fathers decision to step down. The three share their concern over the future of the country as well as the deteriorating health of the older sister.

When spray painting at night, she is again encountered by the same impoverished man. He seems to approach her in a much friendlier manner, yet before they manage to fully engage in a conversation, patrolling policemen notice them. While she manages to run away, the man is caught. Although at first he refuses to reveal her identity to the authorities, he cracks under pressure after a violent interrogation, feeling guilty.

Next day at school, the authorities are looking for the culprit, and notice that V’s features match the forensic sketch and begin an investigation. As her mother finds out about the situation, she is very angry with her daughter and lashes out. As she is being arrested, her mother is crying, and her father does not make it back from Washington in time to see his daughter off.

Before trial, as the investigation progresses, still without substantial proof, protests begin against her imprisonment. She is visited by her mother, who begs her not to confess her guilt, stating that she is already about to lose one daughter and she does not want to lose another. V then speaks to her father, who opens up to her about his stepping down, explaining the reasons behind his decision, namely trying to look out for the family and putting it ahead of his principles. He then acknowledges her bravery and leaves the decision of whether or not to plead guilty to her, stating that he is proud of her and that her righteousness will lead her to make the right decision, and ensuring her that he will support her no matter what. The protagonist breaks down, wishing she could seek advice from her older sister.

The movie ends with growing protests all across New York and elsewhere and increasing media coverage of the case (possibly the voiceover from the beginning resumes), as the protagonist is in the courtroom, confessing guilt. It is explained that she hopes that her case will inspire change, and acknowledges that a hidden identity is not as effective a symbol of resistance, choosing to abandon her freedom and her art for the sake of the greater good. It is mentioned that a chance exists that she will be let out of prison if the elections taking place in two years result in a more democratic and constitutional government. As the trial is taking place, the family gets notified that V’s older sister is making an unexpected recovery.

Through the way the script is written, V’s actual name is never mentioned, adding a sense of ambiguity and emphasizing that she is one with her art.
