The poster is inspired by celebrities’ instagram quote post “Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle” after Anthony’s Bourdain’s unfortunate suicide news. 
“I should’ve died in my 20s. I became successful in my 40s. I became a dad in my 50s. I feel like I’ve stolen a car — a really nice car — and I keep looking in the rearview mirror for flashing lights.”  This was from one of Anthony Bourdain’s early interviews. In the modern world, so much is deceived by what we put on outside, as an appearance, on social media. It is harder to spot an unhappy soul and for an unhappy to reach out for help. I want to design the poster in a very loud way to remind people kindness is needed more than ever for us to survive.  
The random positions of the message “Be Kind” imitates the sticker wall art seen on New York Streets. The repetition speaks to the audience directly. I used the font Agipo, a very conceptually distinct style to me.
