<p><div class="text1">At that time Tavernier wrote in his Six Voy</br>ages: “The first piece that Akel Khan (Chi-</br> ef Keeper of the King’s jewels) placed in</br>  my hands was the great diamond, which is</br>  rose cut, round and very high on one side.</br> On the lower edge there is a slight crack,</br> and a little flaw in it. Its water is fine,</br> and weighs 319-1/2 ratis, which makes 280</br>  of our carats, the rati being ⅞th of a carat.”</div></p>

The Great Mogul Diamond’s story begins</br> around 1650 with its discovery as a rough diamond,</br> most probably in the Kollur Mine</br> in the Golconda region of southern India.</br> Weighing in at a whopping 787 ½ carats,</br> the diamond’s impressive size</br> made it a perfect gift of diplomacy</br> when Emir Jemla, a very wealthy general,</br> used it in seeking an alliance</br> between two great families.</div></p>

Later,</br> the Great Mogul Diamond became</br> part of the spoils of war</br> when India was invaded and</br> Delhi sacked by the Persian</br> ruler Nadir Shah.

<div class="lightbox hide6">
<p><div class="text3">
Nadir Shah, the Persian ruler returned with the stone</br> to his home in Isfahan in 1739.</br> However, Nadir Shah’s ownership proved shorted-lived.</br> He was assassinated in 1747</br> and the stone disappeared.</br>There are many legends regarding its fate.</br> Some believed it to be the stone</br> from which the Koh-i-noor was cut,</br> or perhaps the Darya-ye-noor,</br> but most popularly it is speculated to be the Orlov Diamond</br> because its bluish tinge and rose cut</br> are similar to the Great Mogul Diamond.</br> A more probable explanation is that</br> it was stolen and cut into smaller gems to disguise its origin.</br>No one knows for sure.

No one knows for sure.</br> Where are you, Indiana Jones?
</div>
<div class="lightbox hide8">
<p><div class="text4">
This is the kind of story</br> that would make a great Indiana Jones movie</br> – solving the mystery of the Great Mogul Diamond.</br>Its last owner murdered, </br>the famed gem has not been seen for centuries</br> and to this day its whereabouts remain unknown.</br> Still, theories swirl about its fate.</br> Who stole the gem? </br>Is it now part of someone’s private collection?</br> Perhaps it is truly lost, </br>patiently waiting somewhere on this earth</br> to be re-discovered. </br>Or maybe it has gone under the knife,</br> cut down to disguise its identity.
