My name is Jerry Scalise, I was a high ranking member of the Chicago outfit.</br>
I was a soldier for Chicago mob boss Albert Tocco in the 70’s.</br>
They called me ‘wild bunch’ back then.</br> 
I was never caught in any of my crimes.</br>
But the story changed on September 11th 1980 </br>
when The Brain and I were about to execute one the biggest heists in history.</br>
We had our eyes on a 45-caret Marlborough diamond worth £400,000 at the time.</br>
My partner Rachel booked us rooms at the Mount Royal Hotel.</br>
We were patiently waiting for the night to pass. </br>

My name is Arthur Rachel ‘The Brain’. I was Jerry’s partner.  </br>
I was supposed to be the brain to make sure an unforgettable day of our life. </br>
It all went well back we ran back to the car.</br>
Me and Jerry dressed up properly and entered the store. </br>
Jerry took out the grenade and everyone stood down. </br>
We got the Marlborough diamond and even some other big rocks and put them into the brief.<br>
We ran back into the car and drove away. </br>
Except I put my real name down for our rented get away car.</br>
They got us before we got to the airport. </div> </br>

We both got sent to prison for a long time.<br/>
But no one has ever seen the Marlborough diamond.<br/> 
The police found us but not the priceless stone.<br/> 
Tabloid wrote there was source told that Jerry immediately sent the diamond to his sister in New York City that day. </br>
Don’t ask me. <br/>
Cuz what’s that saying again? Steal don't tell.<br/>
