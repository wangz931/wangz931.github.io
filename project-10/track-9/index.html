Explorer Teddy Tucker found the famous Emerald and Gold Cross just north of Bermuda in 1955 whilst scuba diving.</br> It is believed that its history of the cross dates back to 1594, and was part of a large treasure haul from a Spanish shipwreck.

<div class="lightbox stole hide2">
Sometime before 1975, however, the cross was stolen, and the robbers left a cheap replica in its place.</br>

The replica was found in 1975 when Queen Elizabeth II visited the Maritime Museum to view this treasure.</br>

The priceless piece made of 22 karat gold cross, embedded with sparkling green emeralds, was moved to the Bermuda Museum of Art to display it for Queen Elizabeth II.</br>

The discovery that the cross was a replica caused a media sensation. Nobody could work out who, or even when it had replaced the authentic Tucker Cross.</br>
