Who has the audacity to steal “The Comtesse De Vendome Necklace” from the Tokyo jewelry store, valued at more than $30 million. It is comprised of 116 diamonds, including a 125-carat oval-cut diamond in the center.</br>     

I don’t know who else besides us, the Pink Panthers.</br>  

We are a gang of hundreds of Serbian thieves. </br> 

We have a solid criminal network responsible for hundreds of high-profile heists across Europe and Asia. </br> 

But let me tell you what happened in the store first.</br> 
 
In Toyko, two members of our gang scouted out the store, posing as a couple and purchasing jewelry while they evaluated the security of the store and the location of the necklace. They found that the necklace was kept in a glass display case on the third floor, guarded by only an electronic alarm. </br> 
On March 5, 2004, Djorde Rasovic and Aleksander Radulovic, disguised in wigs, entered the store. After disorienting the shop’s staff with pepper spray, the two smashed through display cases, making off with more than 20 pieces of jewelry, including the Comtesse de Vendome, and fleeing on motorbikes.</br> 
They didn't get way from the crime. But they held on to the location of the necklace. </br> 

This one of a kind necklace is still unfound, probably in a illicit private collection waiting to be sold on a dark web or perhaps it is already broken up so that we can sell all of its stones. </br>
