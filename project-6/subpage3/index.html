            Two members of our gang posed as a couple in a Tokyo Jewlery Store.</br> They found that the necklace was kept in a glass display case</br>
            on the third floor, guarded by only an electronic alarm. </br> 
            On March 5, 2004, they disguised in wigs, entered the store again.</br>
            After disorienting the shopâ€™s staff with pepper spray,</br> the two smashed through display cases,</br> 
            making off with more than 20 pieces of jewelry,</br>
            including the Comtesse de Vendome, and fleeing on motorbikes.
