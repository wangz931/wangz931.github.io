The story starts simply enough.<p>&nbsp</p>
My name is Kriangkrai Techamong,<img src="assets/img/thief.png" width="23%">
<br>
<br> a Thai gardener for a Saudi prince. 
Tired of tending to the royal flower beds, <br>
I decided to steal the flawless 50 carat blue diamond <img src="assets/img/blue-diamond.png" width="7%"> from the prince’s safe.

I climbed into the palace through a second-story window,<br> 
broke into a safe using a screwdriver,<br> 
and stole the diamond—one of the world’s largest blue diamonds and some other gems—into my vacuum bag. <br>
I mailed the jewels to my home in Thailand. And shortly after, I returned to my homeland.<br> 

I sold the stolen jewels to a local jeweler, Santhi Sithanakan,<img src="assets/img/santhi.png" width="10%"> for pennies on the dollar. <br>
The Saudis were able to quickly ascertain what had happened,<br>
and demanded my arrest and the return of the diamond.<br>  

Thai police returned the stolen jewels to Saudi Arabia<br> 
However, once they received the jewels, they found out that the blue diamond is missing and gems<img src="assets/img/gems.png" width="7%" height="7%"> were all fake. <br>

The Saudis decided they needed to conduct their own investigation, <br>
sending three diplomats and a businessman with ties to the royal family to Thailand.<br>

When the diplomats were assassinated and the businessman vanished,<br> 
the Saudis blamed corruption within the Thai government.<br> 
In retaliation, the furious Saudi government recalled its ambassador from Thailand,<br> 
deported more than 90% of the over 200,000 Thai guest workers in Saudi Arabia,<br> 
and cut off almost all trade with Thailand.<br> <p>&nbsp</p> 
The wife and son of the jeweler who bought the stolen gems from me were murdered,<br>  
a crime the detective in charge of the original heist investigation was eventually convicted of orchestrating.<br> 

The Blue Diamond Affair remains far from being resolved.<br> 
 As of 2016, the murders of the Saudi diplomats and the disappearance of the Saudi businessman remain unsolved,<br>  
 relations between Thailand and Saudi Arabia are still frosty,<br>  
 and the location of the beautiful blue diamond that I stole remains an enduring mystery.<br>
